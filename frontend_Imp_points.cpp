/*
 Now here i will write the important points regarding the frontend of my website.
  
 The tech stacks which i am using for the projects are as follows :--
 for css , i am using the tailwind css
 for fonts , i am using the google inter fonts 
 React-Router :-- for handling the client side routing. 
 React-icons :-- for creating the icons in my project. 
 i am creating the project using the vite@latest command.
 for droping the notification , i am using the sonner library . 


Now here i am getting the two images in case of a mobile version and its reason is that in case of a productDetails.jsx 








Things which i have to study after the completion of the project :--
01) Difference betweeen div and section container.
02) Have to study tailwind css properly because i don't know many things about the class which i have used in this project. 


For uploading the images in the productDetails.jsx file, i am using the cloudinary service.
